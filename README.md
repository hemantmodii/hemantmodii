- 👋 Hi, I’m @hemantmodii
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as i can about Web Development and creating new stuff with my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js for web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Full Stack Development Projects that can provide me real life experience in what i am currently learning.
- 📫 How to reach me : https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemant-modi-1573141b8/
- 😄 Pronouns: req/res
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing chess, and started my first full stack project to be a chess review site(knowing very little about what will be needed to achieve that) and failed spectacularly. Now i am learning the skills necessary to implement my original idea and I still have a long way to go, but I have learnt alot since then.
